The first objective was to build a publishing platform that would include multiple sets of content types, with isolated author access to entries based on user permissions, the type of content and authorship. Additionally, the pieces of content needed a relational component in order to easily reference each other throughout the many facets of the website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the initial requirements and the need to accommodate an array of future unidentified features, we immediately thought of using \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://buildwithcraft.com/\"\u003eCraft\u003c/a\u003e. We had used it previously for a handful of smaller projects and absolutely loved the entire experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy Craft?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCraft is a CMS that works wonderfully with structured data, and it doesn’t make any unnecessary assumptions about how that data will be used on the front-end. It provides a head start by supplying the common features needed for a publishing platform such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser accounts and fine-grained permissions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContent entry with drafts and versioning\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn assortment of built-in field-types\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA robust query builder\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRouting \u0026amp; pagination\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost importantly, it has a powerful API to extend its functionality for your project’s specific needs which we’ll be discussing in future blog posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Publishing User Experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s important for us to enjoy building products with Craft, it’s even more important that our clients enjoy using the CMS. Thankfully, the client feedback from previous projects has been excellent. Navigating the CMS’ admin is simple and straightforward, while managing content is extremely easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA feature that was especially loved is the \u003cem\u003eLive Preview\u003c/em\u003e feature, which displays a side-by-side view of the content entry page and the actual output that visitors will see. This is notable because as content and data is entered, this feature of Craft will render the end result as the content changes. Here is Craft’s official promo video of it in action:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"video\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/111679726?title=0\u0026amp;amp;byline=0\u0026amp;amp;portrait=0\u0026amp;amp;color=f27390\u0026amp;amp;badge=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLive Preview in action.

The plan is to extract some of these from the project and open source them in the coming weeks. We’ll be following up with more blog posts when we do, as well as tips on Craft configuration and deployment. Check back here or subscribe to our \u003ca href=\"/newsletter\"\u003emonthly newsletter\u003c/a\u003e to receive updates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEverything considered, Craft was a wonderful choice for this project and we highly recommend taking a look at it for your next endeavor. We certainly can’t wait to use it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/a-study-in-craft/a-study-in-craft-11bd258c.jpg"},{"id":"/blog/always-have-a-solid-backup-plan/","title":"Always Have a Solid Backup Plan","description":"How we are leveraging cloud services to keep all of our design and development files backed up.","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/blog/always-have-a-solid-backup-plan/","path":"/blog/always-have-a-solid-backup-plan/","published":"2015-02-03T07:00:00-06:00","updated":"2015-02-16T18:11:57-06:00","author":{"name":"James LaCroix","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/team/james-lacroix/","path":"/team/james-lacroix/","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/team/james-lacroix-bd5b0b76.jpg"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eThis past autumn, I once again had the opportunity to work with long-time friends and clients, \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://relientk.com\"\u003eRelient K\u003c/a\u003e designing and producing merchandise for their upcoming tour. Celebrating the 10-year anniversary of their best-selling album, \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmhmm\"\u003eMMHMM\u003c/a\u003e, the tour was slated to be a special event for both the band and their fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to newly designed merchandise, the members of Relient K wanted to reprint classic merchandise from the timeframe of their original record release. This led me to an exploration of art files from 10 years back. Many of these files predated LaCroix Design Co. and I was amazed to find that I had retained so many of the design files and records from this time. We were successfully able to manufacture the classic apparel and the tour was a huge success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince starting LaCroix Design Co. in 2005, we have been victims of a burglary and numerous hard drive failures. The fact that I had retained a collection of files from ten years back was more of a testament to luck than any full-proof backup plan. However, we’ve never been content leaving this up to luck alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the beginning, we have made deliberate decisions to ensure that work we create for our clients is systematically backed up and available for years to come. This is an overview of the redundant system we are using to keep all our files safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSystem Wide\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur backup plan starts with individual computers. This ensures everything on our systems is accessible at any given time. Should we experience a system malfunction, hard drive failure, theft or some other disaster, these backups are available to help us get up and running quickly. These system solutions work in tandem with the other services we outline to provide redundancy.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eTime Machine\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe start with \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\"\u003eTime Machine\u003c/a\u003e, the built-in backup feature of OS X. This feature retains a copy of our of our files, as well as a feature that expresses how our system looked on any given day. These backups are synced via our wireless network and stored on two separate hard drives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eBackblaze\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTime Machine is a terrific feature, but it is backing up the files to disks which reside at the same physical location as our computers. Thus, we require something that will allow us to backup the bulk of our files to remote storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lcrx.co/1vplTMd\"\u003eBackblaze\u003c/a\u003e excels. For $50 a year, Backblaze will continuously backup an unlimited amount of data from you computer and any drives attached to it. This provides us access to multiple versions of our files through its online interface. Or, we may request the shipment of a hard drive with all of our data on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this backup process is not a fast as a locally attached device or Time Machine running on our local network, Backblaze provides us with a sound piece of mind knowing that our files are continuously being backed up off-site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eDesign Files\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe find it important to create an additional level of backup for our design files. Very often, these files can be quite large and a loss of the editable versions would require an inordinate amount of time to recreate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eLayerVault\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor many years, we stored all of our working design files on Dropbox so that we could access them from anywhere. We have since replaced this with one of my most relied-upon online services, \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://layervault.com/r/3X2\"\u003eLayerVault\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLayerVault provides remote version control for all of our art files and a slew of other vital features. Years ago, we attempted to version-control our design files using Git, which resulted in oversized repositories. Thus, we were thrilled to discover that LayerVault offered this crucial service and provided file previews for each version. We no longer have to save versions of a file out as final-1, final-2, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to automatically versioning all of our design files, LayerVault allows us to share project files internally or with an external team. As a result, others involved in a project will always have access to the latest design files and assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, LayerVault retains all of our project files and allows us to leave and rejoin a project at any time. Thus, we are able to remove a folder of project files from our computer and rejoin the project at a later date. Doing so will, in turn, sync all of the design files for a project back to our computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eVault Drive\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs an added layer of backup, I keep a large hard drive of every LaCroix Design Co. project connected to my computer. As projects are completed, they are organized in folders by year. Additionally, font files and other assets are regularly archived on this drive. Since the drive is attached to my system, it is also backed up using Backblaze. While I imagine that this drive may one day be replaced by \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/\"\u003eAmazon Glacier\u003c/a\u003e or something similar, but this current setup has been working out very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eDevelopment Files\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs our design process evolved from building static designs in traditional design applications to a process of iterating, prototyping and building interactive experiences with code, versioning and keeping backups of development files has become immensely important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eRepositories\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of our development projects are version-controlled using \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://git-scm.com/\"\u003eGit\u003c/a\u003e. We host the majority of these repositories publicly and privately on \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e and utilize \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\"\u003eBitbucket\u003c/a\u003e to host repositories for our smaller projects that we wish to keep private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eDocuments \u0026amp; Meeting Notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDocuments for all projects are stored on \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\"\u003eGoogle Drive\u003c/a\u003e and also archived along with all design files onto our Vault Drive upon the completion of each project. \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lcrx.co/1DylAxU\"\u003eEvernote\u003c/a\u003e is used to record all meeting notes, which are then shared internally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf it is not obvious by now, our backup process is very important to us. Being able to provide files and assets years after a project is over allows us to continually exceed the expectations of the clients that partner with us. Feel free to \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/lacroixdesign\"\u003ecomment on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e if you have any questions or need clarity as to how we are using these tools and services.\u003c/p\u003e\n","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/always-have-a-solid-backup-plan/always-have-a-solid-backup-plan-15958325.jpg"},{"id":"/blog/website-launch-chicago-food-magazine/","title":"Website Launch: Chicago Food Magazine","description":"We recently designed and developed a new responsive website for exploring Chicago’s growing food scene.","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/blog/website-launch-chicago-food-magazine/","path":"/blog/website-launch-chicago-food-magazine/","published":"2015-01-28T15:00:00-06:00","updated":"2015-02-16T18:11:57-06:00","author":{"name":"James LaCroix","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/team/james-lacroix/","path":"/team/james-lacroix/","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/team/james-lacroix-bd5b0b76.jpg"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eOf all of the things that we enjoy about Chicago, the food scene is probably at the top of the list. By food scene, I’m not referring to Chicago dogs, deep dish or Italian beef. Instead, I’m talking about the fast-growing assortment of new establishments opening by some of the nation’s most notable new chefs and entrepreneurs. When we are not behind our computers or sketching new ideas at our desks, you will most often find us enjoying craft beers, cocktails and/or a delicious meal somewhere that is most likely becoming our new favorite bar or restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can imagine our delight when we began talking with \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chicagofoodmagazine.com/\"\u003eChicago Food Magazine\u003c/a\u003e back in October. Their team had already begun documenting Chicago’s growing restaurant population through captivating photography. With a vibrant social media presence in place and an ever-growing subscriber base, the team was ready to make their foray into publishing content on their own platform. Their goal was to create an online magazine that provides informative posts on the Chicago food scene in addition to breaking information on news and events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout our correspondence with Chicago Food Magazine, we brainstormed features and devised a plan for a publishing platform that would be able to meet their current goals while also providing a strong foundation for future developments. This platform provides the editorial team with tools to publish articles that include a variety of image and social media elements on the responsive website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur design process produced a scalable visual system that would highlight their rich use of photography and provide a pleasant reading experience for visitors. With a large social media following already in place, an important part of the website’s development involved creating a system for sharing content through those channels. To keep followers informed, breaking news is automatically dispersed across those outlets as articles are published.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are thrilled to have had the opportunity to design and develop the new Chicago Food Magazine website. Even more so, we have thoroughly enjoyed the content that the magazine has been producing since launch.

The original Bourbon was being utilized in our projects for a couple years at that point, however we ran into compilation issues when trying to include it directly since LibSass does not have 100% feature compatibility with Ruby Sass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe decided to create a project which would include workarounds for those issues, while also providing some conveniences for Node.js-based build tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur primary goals for the project were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA focus on LibSass compatibility\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePackaged for npm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA convenience method for supplying the project path to both the build tool and to other libraries that might depend on it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eHow to use it\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll provide an example for using node-bourbon in a gulp.js project.

My time spent working in the music industry piqued my interest in entrepreneurship and small business ventures, but I initially knew very little about running a design studio. With no previous experience as a design employee, my company was a blank canvas for how a design studio could be run. Of course, this has resulted in plenty of mistakes and hard lessons but over time, I\u0026rsquo;ve continually welcomed the opportunity to experiment with all aspects of the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same manner that we use design thinking to deliver successful solutions for our clients, we believe that design thinking can be applied to the process that leads us to those results. Experimentation and iteration provides continual improvement in the way we operate. One such experiment meant moving my company nearly 500 miles from Nashville to Chicago. The relocation provided us with an opportunity to move out of our comfort zone in order to improve as designers and developers. It also made me grow as a business owner. Leaving a small market where my business was established and operating successfully to a much larger market where we would be virtually unknown offered its fair share of opportunities and risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo ease the transition, Michael remained in Nashville for a year and we began working remotely. Operating out of separate locations meant that we had to adjust our workflows to ensure that the quality of our work would not slip but rather improve as we began to enter a larger market. As with any new experiment, our foray into remote work had its bumps and bruises. Before long, we had adapted and found ourselves relishing in our newfound workflows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve months ago, this year-long experiment came to an end as Michael made the move to Chicago so that we could once again work within the same office. Now, with a full year of working beside one another, we have realized that the lessons learned from working remotely have made us better designers, developers and communicators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe became better writers.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRemote work eliminated the opportunity for casual conversation. Phone calls and video chats consume too much time so we chose to limit those to important occasions. Writing became our main source of communication. This required articulation with our thoughts in order to get our points across clearly and efficiently. Whether using email, project management software or our internal chat software, working remotely demanded deliberate thought when sharing our ideas and critiques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn turn, this helped with client correspondence as well. We devised systems for reviewing and editing proposals or any long-form communications with clients. This required that initial contributor took the time to encompass all of the finer details of the project so that the reviewer would be able to provide edits that helped to clarify the material. Often, we would review documents several times to assure that our correspondence represented the same thoughtfulness that we give to our work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe had to be more organized.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen working remotely, little things that slip through the cracks can\u0026rsquo;t happen. Thus, we had to develop a bulletproof set of systems that we still use today. Completed tasks needed to be recorded so that both partners were keenly aware of what needed to be accomplished. Additionally, keeping files and resources organized was crucial for streamlined workflow at both offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe relied on our project management software to meet these needs. The tool that we were already using, \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/\"\u003eBasecamp\u003c/a\u003e, was our initial solution. Utilizing email as its notification channel, Basecamp allowed us to also bring clients into the project management software. This way, our clients could observe and communicate as their project was progressing. We have since progressed to using \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://trello.com/jameslacroix/recommend\"\u003eTrello\u003c/a\u003e for all internal projects and have begun testing it on some client projects. Trello provides us with a more visual view of the project status. Additionally, tasks can proceed through a series of stages rather than simply complete or incomplete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile working in remote offices, we still needed to have a channel for regular conversation \u0026mdash; enter chat service. We initially used \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://campfirenow.com/\"\u003eCampfire\u003c/a\u003e, followed by \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hipchat.com/\"\u003eHipchat\u003c/a\u003e and then happily landed on \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://slack.com/r/024l00bf-02533q4k\"\u003eSlack\u003c/a\u003e. To this day, the majority of our conversations still take place in Slack. The service provides separate channels to keep our thoughts organized and the ability to search through these communications at a later time. Seamlessly working with third-party applications, Slack will notify us of Trello updates or Git commits. It will also parse the information from shared links which allow us to quickly share screenshots of ideas using \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.getcloudapp.com/\"\u003eCloudApp\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe learned to be more decisive.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the fallbacks of being a designer or developer is overthinking our solutions. We are all guilty of this from time to time. Self-doubt will sometimes creep in and minor iterations end up consuming hours of work only to return to where you first started. When working in the same office, it is quite convenient to distract a co-worker for feedback on every little step. In this circumstance, self-doubt begins to paralyze your workflow. Working remotely required proactive and confident decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, this experiment in working remotely has had a lasting, positive\neffect on our non-remote workflows. After working in the\nsame office for a year now, we\u0026rsquo;ve found that these changes have improved the productivity and quality of our work.\u003c/p\u003e\n","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/lessons-learned-from-working-remotely/lessons-learned-from-working-remotely-8efd083e.jpg"},{"id":"/blog/keeping-workplace-morale-high/","title":"Keeping Workplace Morale High","description":"Meet Dempsey, the lesser known member of our team.","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/blog/keeping-workplace-morale-high/","path":"/blog/keeping-workplace-morale-high/","published":"2014-05-29T16:30:00-05:00","updated":"2015-02-16T18:11:57-06:00","author":{"name":"James LaCroix","url":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/team/james-lacroix/","path":"/team/james-lacroix/","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/team/james-lacroix-bd5b0b76.jpg"},"content":"\u003cfigure class=\"image-stretch-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Dempsey\" class=\"image-fullwidth\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/keeping-workplace-morale-high/dempsey-office-f7fe3a92.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe love designing and developing for the web.

Odds are if you are reading this, you\u0026rsquo;ve seen the site and I hope that you are enjoying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI can not recall how many sites for our company have come before this one but I know that this is now the third one that I have worked on with Michael and as with each one before it, I believe that this one is the best yet. Prior to addition of Michael\u0026rsquo;s developer expertise, LaCroix Design Co. consisted of just me. Initially, I had no desire to design for the web and never imagined that I would wish to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy evolution to web designer came out of a necessity. Quite frankly, I needed a way for people to see the graphic design, illustration and identity work that I was doing. Armed with a handful of video tutorials, I began tearing apart WordPress templates in an attempt to mold them into some semblance of a portfolio site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time that I discovered something new about the way people interacted with the web or how to develop for it, I would start over and construct a new portfolio site. As a learned to love the design process, this would typically involve coding through the night in order to see something come together by daylight. Sometimes these sites would last months and sometimes mere weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith every new site, I sought to do more. I still remember the time that I decided to build an entire site solely because I had learned to animate an accordion menu with a JavaScript library. Every iteration was an experiment utilizing all of the knowledge that I had up to that point. I wanted to include it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis method continued with the addition of Michael to the team. Michael\u0026rsquo;s skill set and ideas brought super powers to everything that I had been attempting to do. The first LaCroix Design Co. site that we built moved us away from WordPress and onto Expression Engine. This iteration focused on adding more functionality as well as aesthetic bells and whistles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that we, we created the predecessor to this site. It was the first responsive web site that we made for ourselves and began to showcase not only the visual nature of our projects but also the design thinking and process that went into them. Not fully content with any content management system available, this site was powered by a custom built web application to demonstrate our studio\u0026rsquo;s development skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis leads us to our most recent iteration. For the first time in nearly nine years, we did not attempt to add more and sought to reduce wherever possible. Although we are still quite proud of our custom content management system, we abandoned it due to lack of necessity. When both members of the team are comfortable with HTML \u0026amp; CSS, a content management system is overkill and removing it increases the speed of the site. Additionally, we reduced the copy and amount of pages to provide a simpler user experience. Design should facilitate rather than get in the way of the stories that we always want to share through our site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy having less, we have the capability to iterate more quickly. Rather than wait another year or two to create a new site, changes can be quickly made as we examine the interactions taking place. I would trust that the site will not look exactly the same next month as it does today. We are excited about what we have learned and planned to share more specific details about it in the coming weeks and months. We hope that you find delight in the new site and more importantly the work that we have done for our clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n","thumbnail":"http://www.lacroixdesign.net/images/blog/doing-more-with-less/doing-more-with-less-dbabc9ed.jpg"}]
